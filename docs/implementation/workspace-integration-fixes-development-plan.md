## 🔍 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks (P1-P3 Severity)

#### Risk 1: WebSocket Connection Race Conditions (P1 - High)
**Impact**: Terminal functionality may still fail intermittently  
**Probability**: Medium (30%)  
**Mitigation**: 
- Comprehensive timeout handling (5 seconds max)
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism (1s, 2s, 5s, 15s)
- Graceful degradation to polling mode if WebSocket fails
- **Fallback**: Terminal works without real-time streaming

#### Risk 2: State Synchronization Conflicts (P2 - Medium)  
**Impact**: Inconsistent focus states in multi-user scenarios  
**Probability**: Low (15%)  
**Mitigation**:
- Version-controlled state with conflict resolution
- Last-write-wins policy with timestamp validation
- Atomic state updates with transaction-like behavior
- **Fallback**: Manual state refresh endpoint

#### Risk 3: Performance Degradation (P2 - Medium)
**Impact**: Solution might introduce latency or resource usage  
**Probability**: Low (10%)  
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain existing 60% CPU reduction from focus-based streaming
- Connection pooling to limit resource usage
- Performance monitoring with alerts
- **Fallback**: Feature flags to disable problematic features

#### Risk 4: Backward Compatibility Issues (P3 - Low)
**Impact**: Existing terminals or browser sessions might break  
**Probability**: Very Low (5%)  
**Mitigation**:
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Extensive backward compatibility testing
- Version detection for API changes
- **Fallback**: Quick rollback to previous version

### Business Risks

#### Risk 1: Development Timeline Overrun (P2 - Medium)
**Impact**: Delayed delivery affects user productivity longer  
**Probability**: Medium (25%)  
**Mitigation**:
- Phase-based delivery (can ship Phase 1+2 independently)
- Daily progress tracking with blockers escalation
- Resource allocation buffer (20% extra time)
- **Contingency**: Ship critical fixes first, enhance later

#### Risk 2: User Adoption Resistance (P3 - Low)
**Impact**: Users may not trust the fix after multiple issues  
**Probability**: Low (10%)  
**Mitigation**:
- Clear communication about fixes
- Gradual rollout to power users first
- Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
- **Strategy**: Success stories and performance metrics sharing
