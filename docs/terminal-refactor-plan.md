# Terminal WebSocket Refactor - Development Plan

## Executive Summary

Refactor 7+ terminal services (4,600+ lines) into 3 clean, focused services to improve performance by 60%, reduce memory usage by 50%, and eliminate state management issues.

## ✅ Development Planner Self-Verification

### Prerequisites Check

- [✓] Current codebase analyzed (8 terminal services, 4,631 total lines)
- [✓] Performance requirements understood (60% CPU reduction, 50% memory reduction)
- [✓] Backward compatibility requirements identified
- [✓] Zero-downtime migration requirement acknowledged

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Services (4,631 lines total):**

1. terminal.service.ts (630 lines) - Main terminal management
2. terminal-memory.service.ts (1,035 lines) - Session state management
3. terminal-orchestrator.service.ts (493 lines) - Process coordination
4. terminal-lifecycle.service.ts (403 lines) - Session lifecycle
5. terminal-metrics.service.ts (476 lines) - Performance metrics
6. terminal-analytics.service.ts (404 lines) - Usage analytics
7. terminal-logging.service.ts (514 lines) - Logging infrastructure
8. terminal-memory-pool.service.ts (254 lines) - Memory pooling

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High Risk Items

1. **State Loss During Migration**
   - Mitigation: Dual-write to both old and new services
   - Rollback: Feature flag to revert instantly
2. **WebSocket Connection Drops**
   - Mitigation: Implement connection pooling and retry logic
   - Rollback: Keep old WebSocket handlers active

3. **Memory Leaks in New Code**
   - Mitigation: Continuous memory profiling during development
   - Rollback: Circuit breaker to switch back if memory exceeds threshold

### Medium Risk Items

1. **Performance Regression**
   - Mitigation: Run parallel benchmarks continuously
   - Rollback: Feature flag based on performance metrics

2. **API Contract Breaking**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive contract testing
   - Rollback: Adapter pattern maintains compatibility

### Low Risk Items

1. **UI Component Issues**
   - Mitigation: Extensive integration testing
   - Rollback: Frontend feature flags

## Rollback Procedures

### Phase 1 Rollback (Days 1-3)

```bash
# No rollback needed - new code isolated
git revert --no-commit HEAD~n
```

### Phase 2 Rollback (Days 4-6)

```bash
# Disable feature flags
echo "TERMINAL_REFACTOR_ENABLED=false" >> .env
npm run restart
```

### Phase 3 Rollback (Days 7-10)

```bash
# Switch to legacy services via feature flags
curl -X POST http://localhost:4110/api/admin/feature-flags \
  -d '{"terminal_refactor": false}'

# Monitor for 30 minutes
npm run monitor:terminals
```

### Phase 4-5 Rollback (Days 11-15)

```bash
# Full revert with data migration
./scripts/rollback-terminal-refactor.sh
npm run migrate:rollback
npm run restart
```

## Performance Validation Steps

### Baseline Metrics (Before Refactor)

```bash
# Capture current metrics
npm run metrics:capture --tag=baseline
```

### Continuous Monitoring

```bash
# Run during development
npm run metrics:compare --baseline=baseline --current=HEAD
```

### Final Validation

```bash
# Load test with 100 concurrent sessions
npm run test:load --sessions=100 --duration=300s

# Memory profiling
npm run profile:memory --duration=3600s

# CPU profiling
npm run profile:cpu --operations=10000
```
