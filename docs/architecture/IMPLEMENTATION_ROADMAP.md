## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Planning

### High-Risk Areas

#### Technical Risks

1. **WebSocket Scalability**: Real-time features may not scale
   - **Mitigation**: Early load testing, connection pooling, fallback to polling
   - **Contingency**: Implement progressive enhancement with polling fallback

2. **Mobile App Store Approval**: Flutter app may face approval delays
   - **Mitigation**: Follow store guidelines strictly, early submission for review
   - **Contingency**: PWA as primary mobile solution if store approval delayed

3. **AI API Rate Limits**: Claude API may throttle requests
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching, request queuing, and fallback responses
   - **Contingency**: Gradual rollout with usage monitoring

#### Timeline Risks

1. **Feature Complexity Underestimation**: Some features may take longer
   - **Mitigation**: Buffer time in each sprint, regular velocity tracking
   - **Contingency**: Feature prioritization and scope reduction if needed

2. **Integration Delays**: Backend services may not be ready
   - **Mitigation**: Mock services, parallel development, clear API contracts
   - **Contingency**: Extended testing phase with real data integration

### Success Metrics & KPIs

#### Development Metrics

- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Quality**: Bug discovery rate, test coverage percentage
