## 3. Code Reuse Opportunities

### Existing Components (70% Reusable)

```typescript
// Already Available - Direct Reuse
├── UI Components (src/components/ui/)
│   ├── Button, Card, Input, Modal (100% reusable)
│   ├── Table, Tabs, Badge (100% reusable)
│   └── Alert, Loading, Tooltip (100% reusable)
├── Layout Components (src/components/layout/)
│   ├── AppLayout (100% reusable)
│   ├── Sidebar, MainNavigation (100% reusable)
│   └── Breadcrumbs (100% reusable)
├── Auth System (src/core/auth/)
│   ├── authClient (100% reusable)
│   └── JWT handling (100% reusable)
└── Terminal V2 Architecture (Reference Pattern)
    ├── WebSocket patterns (Adapt for Portfolio)
    ├── Store architecture (Copy pattern)
    └── Session management (Adapt pattern)
```

### New Development Required (30%)

```typescript
// Must Build New
├── Portfolio Components
│   ├── PortfolioDashboard
│   ├── StockPriceTicker
│   ├── TradingForm
│   └── PerformanceChart
├── Service Clients
│   ├── PortfolioServiceClient
│   ├── StockDataClient
│   └── TradingClient
└── State Management
    ├── portfolioStore
    └── stockPriceStore
```

## 4. Integration Strategy

### Service Communication Architecture

```typescript
// Layered Integration Approach
Frontend App
    ↓
Gateway Client (Port 4110)
    ↓
Service Router
    ├── User Management (4100)
    ├── AI Assistant (4130)
    ├── Terminal (4140)
    ├── Workspace (4150)
    └── Portfolio (4160) [NEW]
```

### Integration Pattern

```typescript
// Standard Service Client Pattern
class PortfolioServiceClient extends BaseServiceClient {
  constructor() {
    super({
      baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL || "http://localhost:4110",
      service: "portfolio",
      timeout: 5000,
      retries: 3,
    });
  }

  // Leverage existing patterns from terminal.service.client.ts
  async getPortfolios() {
    return this.get("/api/portfolio/list");
  }

  // WebSocket pattern from Terminal V2
  subscribeToUpdates(portfolioId: string) {
    return this.ws.subscribe(`portfolio:${portfolioId}`);
  }
}
```
