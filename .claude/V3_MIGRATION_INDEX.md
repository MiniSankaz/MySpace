## 📝 Important Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **PM2 for process management** (no Docker)
2. **6 microservices** on different ports
3. **Progressive migration** to avoid downtime
4. **Reuse Terminal V2** clean architecture
5. **Shared libraries** for common code

### Risk Management

- **Data consistency**: Using distributed transactions
- **Service failures**: Circuit breakers implemented
- **Performance**: Extensive testing planned
- **Rollback**: 3-level rollback procedures ready
