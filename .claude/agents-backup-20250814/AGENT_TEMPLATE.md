2. **‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏¥‡πà‡∏° entry ‡πÉ‡∏ô Agent Work Log** section:
   ```markdown
   ### [Current Date/Time] - [Agent Name]

   **Task:** [Brief description]
   **Changes:**

   - [List of changes made]
     **Issues Found:**
   - [Any issues discovered]
     **Solutions:**
   - [Solutions implemented]
   ```

### **Special Requirements by Agent Type:**

#### For Business/Requirements Agents:

- Focus on updating Business Logic section
- Document user stories and acceptance criteria
- Update Feature List with detailed specifications

#### For Development/Code Agents:

- Update File/Module Structure
- Document new components and services
- Add import examples and usage patterns

#### For DevOps/Infrastructure Agents:

- Update deployment and CI/CD information
- Document infrastructure changes
- Add monitoring and alerting details

#### For Testing/QA Agents:

- Update test accounts and test data
- Document test coverage improvements
- Add testing commands and procedures

#### For Security/Compliance Agents:

- Update security standards and protocols
- Document compliance requirements
- Add security-related commands

### **Quality Checks:**

Before considering work complete, verify:

- [ ] CLAUDE.md has been read at start
- [ ] All relevant sections have been updated
- [ ] New discoveries are documented
- [ ] Work log entry is added
- [ ] Examples and usage guides are included
- [ ] Known issues are documented with workarounds
- [ ] Commands are tested and documented

### **Integration with Other Agents:**

When multiple agents work on the same project:

1. Check the Agent Work Log to see recent changes
2. Review updates made by other agents
3. Ensure your changes don't conflict
4. Build upon previous agent work
5. Reference other agent insights when relevant

## Implementation Instructions

To add this protocol to any agent:

1. Insert the CLAUDE.md requirements section at the beginning of the agent instructions
2. Ensure the agent checks for CLAUDE.md before any task
3. Make the agent update CLAUDE.md after completing work
4. Include specific focus areas based on agent type
5. Test that the agent properly reads and writes to CLAUDE.md

This ensures all agents maintain consistent project documentation and can build upon each other's work effectively.
