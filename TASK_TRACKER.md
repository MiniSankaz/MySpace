2. **Week 2**: Frontend integration

### Phase 4: Testing & Production (1 week)

1. **Integration testing**
2. **Performance optimization**
3. **Production deployment**

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Start Services (Development Mode)

```bash
# Start all services in parallel
./scripts/start-v3.sh

# Start services sequentially
./scripts/start-v3.sh sequential

# Start specific services only
./scripts/start-v3.sh selective gateway,user-management
```

### Stop Services

```bash
# Graceful stop all services
./scripts/stop-v3.sh

# Force kill all services
./scripts/stop-v3.sh force

# Stop specific services
./scripts/stop-v3.sh selective gateway,user-management
```

### Service Management

```bash
# View service logs
pm2 logs
pm2 logs gateway

# Monitor services
pm2 monit

# Service status
pm2 status

# Restart services
pm2 restart all
pm2 restart gateway
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check all service health
for port in 4110 4100 4130 4140 4150 4160; do
  echo "Port $port: $(curl -s http://localhost:$port/health | jq -r '.status')"
done

# Check service info
curl http://localhost:4110/info | jq
```

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Services are placeholder implementations** - Only health checks and basic routing
2. **No inter-service communication** - Services are isolated
3. **Database not yet adapted** - Still using monolithic database schema
4. **Frontend not yet updated** - Still calling monolithic API endpoints

### Technical Debt to Address

1. **Service Discovery**: Implement dynamic service registration
2. **Configuration Management**: Centralized config for all services
3. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Service metrics and alerts
4. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specs for each service
5. **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests

### Security Considerations

1. **Inter-service Authentication**: JWT or service tokens
2. **Network Security**: Service-to-service encryption
3. **Rate Limiting**: Per-service rate limits
4. **Input Validation**: Consistent validation across services

## 📊 Metrics & Goals

### Performance Targets

- **Service Startup Time**: < 5 seconds per service
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for health checks
- **Memory Usage**: < 200MB per service (development)
- **CPU Usage**: < 10% per service (idle)

### Reliability Targets

- **Uptime**: 99.9% per service
- **Error Rate**: < 1%
- **Recovery Time**: < 30 seconds

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Phase 1

✅ **All Completed Successfully:**

1. **Infrastructure Ready**: All 6 services have proper structure and configuration
2. **Development Workflow**: Scripts for easy start/stop/management of services
3. **Monitoring Ready**: Health checks and basic monitoring in place
4. **Type Safety**: Shared types ensure consistency across services
5. **Logging Ready**: Centralized, structured logging implemented
6. **Documentation**: Clear task tracking and development guidelines

**Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Service Implementation** 🚀
