# Database Migration Status - Local PostgreSQL

## Migration Date: 2025-08-20

### Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Due to DigitalOcean database connectivity issues (port 25060 unreachable), all services have been temporarily migrated to local PostgreSQL databases.

## Migration Summary

### üóÑÔ∏è Local PostgreSQL Databases Created

| Service | Database Name | Status | Tables Created |
|---------|--------------|--------|----------------|
| Portfolio Service | `portfolio_db` | ‚úÖ Migrated | 8 tables |
| User Management Service | `user_management_db` | ‚úÖ Migrated | 20+ tables |
| AI Assistant Service | `ai_assistant_db` | ‚úÖ Migrated | 20+ tables |
| Market Data Service | `market_data_db` | ‚úÖ Migrated | 6 tables |
| Workspace Service | `workspace_db` | ‚úÖ Configured | No Prisma schema |
| Terminal Service | N/A | N/A | No database usage |
| Gateway Service | N/A | N/A | No database usage |

## Configuration Changes

### Services Updated
All `.env` files in the following services have been updated:
- `/services/portfolio/.env`
- `/services/user-management/.env`
- `/services/ai-assistant/.env`
- `/services/market-data/.env`
- `/services/workspace/.env`

### Database URLs
```bash
# Old (DigitalOcean - commented out)
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://doadmin:REDACTED@db-postgresql-sgp1-43887-do-user-24411302-0.m.db.ondigitalocean.com:25060/personalAI?sslmode=require"

# New (Local PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://sem4pro@localhost:5432/{database_name}?sslmode=disable"
```

## Sample Data

### Portfolio Service
Successfully seeded with sample data:
- 10 Stocks (5 Thai SET, 5 US NASDAQ)
- 3 Portfolios (THB and USD currencies)
- 11 Holdings with fractional shares support
- 5 Transactions
- 3 Watchlists
- 3 Portfolio snapshots

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check database connectivity
psql -U sem4pro -d postgres -c "\l"

# Test Portfolio Service API
curl -H "x-user-id: user_sankaz_001" http://localhost:4160/api/v1/portfolios

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:4110/health/all
```

## Rollback Instructions

To revert to DigitalOcean database when connectivity is restored:

1. Uncomment the DigitalOcean DATABASE_URL in each service's `.env` file
2. Comment out the local PostgreSQL DATABASE_URL
3. Restart all affected services
4. Run data migration if needed to sync local changes to cloud

## Notes

- All migrations have been successfully applied to local databases
- Services are operational with local PostgreSQL
- No data loss occurred during migration
- Portfolio Service has sample data for testing
- Other services have empty but properly structured databases ready for use

## Action Items

- [ ] Monitor DigitalOcean database connectivity
- [ ] Plan data migration strategy when cloud DB is accessible
- [ ] Consider keeping local DB as development environment
- [ ] Document any schema changes made during local development
